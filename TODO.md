# TODO

- Actually integrate vault
    - Vault-agent?
    - integrate with Nomad
    - integrate with Consul

- REORG - put nomad, consul, and other roles into their own .tf files
- missing CONSUL_COUNT template/config/bootstrap var (like NOMAD_COUNT?)

- Add haproxy and replace traefik with it [apr 2022]
    - You can then access the API at port 5555. For example, in the demo project, http://192.168.50.20:5555/v2/docs will show you the APIâ€™s documentation. 
    - is the dataplane API separate from the consul example that just uses DNS SRV records?

- move nginx into container on nomad
    - it's a great demo of a single-host webserver using consul, though
- use auto-scaling groups for consul, nomad, and traefik
- use an ELB for traefik


- BUG/incomplete: there is no way that /etc/nginx/sites-available/tutorialinux-python is working (in nginx/config/nginx-userdata.sh.tpl)

- move python clients into containers
- serve traffic on the public Internet


## Demo Videos
- service discovery demo
    - HTTP

- consul DNS setup
    - DNS service discovery demo

- load balancing demo


## SMALL TODOs:
- DNS is a little messed up - e.g. sudo -i takes really long because there's something that times out
    sudo: unable to resolve host ip-10-0-10-172: Name or service not known

- set hostnames (for shell prompt and consul)
- add node names in each config (set hostname?) (not a small TODO actually)

Nginx:
- register nginx service with consul on startup (systemd unit file -- postexec?)
